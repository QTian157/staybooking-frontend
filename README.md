# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## 结构
### 1. package.json
**dependency：比较重要的依赖**
### 2. package-lock.json
**能够兼容package.json里依赖版本的最新版本**
**保证团队中所有人用的同一个版本dependencies**
### 3. node_modules
**download package-lock.json的所有dependencies的libararies**
### 4. src
**Index.js: project的js入口文件：完成react的初始化render 同时把底层的App.js放进去**
**Index.css: project的css入口文件**
**App.js: 底层的js**
### 5. public
**原版Html，没有对js的引用**

## 前后端通信
### 前后端通信的API：浏览器自带的 Fetch
**fetch 就是浏览器自带的“发网络请求”的函数：**
**前端用它去请求后端的 API（登录、注册、搜索、下单…），后端返回数据（通常是 JSON）。**

**你可以把它理解成：**
**前端 →（fetch 发请求）→ 后端 →（返回 JSON）→ 前端拿到数据更新页面**
